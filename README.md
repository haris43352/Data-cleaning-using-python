# Automobile Data Analysis - README
## Overview
This project explores a dataset of automobiles to derive insights and present key findings. It includes
data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to highlight trends and
relationships within the data.
## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Identified and handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized
columns for consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored numerical and categorical features to find
correlations, trends, and outliers.
3. **Visualization**: Used plots like scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms to identify patterns such
as price distribution, performance trends, and fuel efficiency.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created derived metrics like price-to-weight ratio and fuel efficiency
rating for deeper analysis.
## Insights and Findings
- **Price vs. Performance**: Found a positive correlation between engine size and price, highlighting
performance as a key cost factor.
- **Fuel Efficiency Trends**: Noted that smaller, lighter cars offer higher fuel efficiency, aligning with
market demand for economical vehicles.
- **Outliers**: Detected anomalies like luxury vehicles significantly deviating in price and weight from
standard models.
## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for code development and visualization
## Applications
This analysis can guide manufacturers in aligning vehicle features with consumer preferences and
help potential buyers make informed decisions based on data.
