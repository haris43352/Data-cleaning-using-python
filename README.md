**Automobile Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes automobile data to uncover insights into factors like engine type, fuel efficiency, price, and other attributes. The analysis used Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data processing and visualization.

**Dataset Details**

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key features:

Symbol: Symboling risk factor.

normalizer_losses: Normalized losses.

Make: Manufacturer of the car.

fuel_type: Type of fuel (e.g., gas, diesel).

Aspiration: Type of aspiration (e.g., turbo, standard).

number_of_doors: Number of doors.

body_style: Body style of the car (e.g., sedan, hatchback).

drive_wheels: Type of drive wheels (e.g., FWD, RWD, 4WD).

engine_location: Location of the engine.

wheel_base: Wheelbase measurement.

Length, width, height: Dimensions of the car.

curb_weight: Weight of the vehicle.

engine_type: Type of engine.

number_of_cylinders: Number of engine cylinders.

engine_size: Engine displacement.

fuel_system: Fuel delivery system.

Bore, stroke: Engine bore and stroke measurements.

compression_ratio: Compression ratio of the engine.

horse_power: Horsepower output.

peak_rpm: Peak revolutions per minute.

city_mpg, highway_mpg: Fuel efficiency in city and highway conditions.

Price: Price of the automobile.

Key Steps in Analysis

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Imported the dataset from a CSV file.

Renamed headers to improve readability.

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

Corrected data types for numerical and categorical columns.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Performed descriptive statistics using df.describe() and df.describe(include='all').

Explored relationships between features like engine size, price, and fuel efficiency.

Analyzed trends and distributions using visualizations.

**Data Visualization:**

Created plots to show correlations between key attributes such as:

Engine Size vs. Price

Fuel efficiency (city/highway mpg) vs. Price

Body style distribution

Used bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize data effectively.

Insights and Observations

Price Drivers: Engine size, horsepower, and luxury features were found to be strong indicators of price.

Fuel Efficiency: Cars with smaller engines and higher compression ratios showed better fuel efficiency.

Market Trends: Hatchbacks and sedans were among the most common body styles.

Risk Factors: Symboling risk factors correlated with price and other features like engine type.

Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, standardized column headers, and handled data type conversions.

Exploratory Analysis: Generated insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Visualization: Built insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Technical Proficiency: Proficient use of Python for data analysis.

How to Run the Analysis

**Clone the repository.**
Install the required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).

Run the Jupyter Notebook file step by step to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

**Recommendations for Improvement**

Feature Engineering: Create additional derived metrics such as cost per horsepower or fuel efficiency index.

Advanced Models: Use machine learning models to predict car prices based on the dataset.

Data Enrichment: Include external data sources for more robust analysis, such as market trends or consumer reviews.

Interactive Dashboards: Develop dashboards in Power BI or Tableau to make insights more accessible to stakeholders.
